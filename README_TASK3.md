## Text preprocessing steps
# 1) Removing stop words and extra unuseful text
These are the most common words in any language and do not add much information to the text. Examples of a few stop words in English are “the”, “a”, “an”, “so”, and “what”. 
# 2) Tokenization
It is a way of separating a piece of text into smaller units called tokens.
# 3) Stemming 
It is the process of reducing a word to its stem. This is important since the Arabic language has several variants of a single term.
# 4) TF-IDF 
It is a text vectorizer that transforms text into a vector form. It is a combination of term frequency and inverse document frequency. Term frequency is defined as the number of times a word i appears in a document j divided by the total number of words in the document.
